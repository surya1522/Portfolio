            I applied extensive industry knowledge in financial services, specifically banking, and investments, to inform data
            analysis and recommendations.
            Successfully worked with large datasets, including analyzing millions of rows of data from multiple countries and
            optimizing processing time using the Python libraries
            Proficiently handled and managed massive datasets for advanced analytical processes, leveraging expertise in data
            science tools and contributing to the entire project lifecycle.
            I am skilled in time-series analysis and predictive modelling using R and Python, specializing in addressing big
            data challenges such as predictive analytics and fraud
            Detection, customer segmentation, and marketing campaigns.</p>
